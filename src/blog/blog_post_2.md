## I get distracted easily, so I should probably make a list

- What I need
    - landing page
    - blog
    - maybe more later, but baby steps
- Make a style guide
    - different themes in the future
    - keep things close to rendered `html`
- Integrate [prism.js](https://prismjs.com/)
- Postcss
    - Got it working (autoprefixer & cssnano), thanks to [5t3ph](https://github.com/5t3ph/11ty-netlify-jumpstart/blob/main/package.json)
- Make javascripts for section header links
