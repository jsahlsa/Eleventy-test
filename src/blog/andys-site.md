I am a bit overdue in writing this one, but I'm sure that only matters to me since I'm the only person paying attention to this blog. My brother came to me a while back to ask for help styling some items on his [squarespace site](https://www.andysahlstrom.com/), and of course I volunteered to just redesign it from the ground up. Ever seen the old [SNL bad idea jeans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGfBEnBw01A) commercial? But seriously, I thought it would be great practice, and would hopefully bolster my portfolio, which I still need to do, but that's another storyâ€¦. 

It's a little late now, but I am building the [site](https://andy-sahlstrom.vercel.app/) live on Netlify and Vercel. I have already hooked up most of the functionality, so now the only purpose it would serve would be to watch how the styles come together.

## Next.js

I had recently discovered the [SSG](https://jamstack.org/generators/) Next.js, and made the somewhat arbitrary decision the use that as my framework. A few things that influenced my decision were:

- I wanted more practice with [React](https://reactjs.org) 
- It seemed like a good option for scaling, specifically if he wanted ease of adding and removing things, maybe by integrating [sanity](https://www.sanity.io/) or another [headless CMS](https://jamstack.org/headless-cms/)
- Based on what I could tell it is fast
- His site has many images and routes, so both the `<Link>` and `<Image>` components were appealing
