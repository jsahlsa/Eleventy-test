# {{ title | capitalize }} Me {.about-me}

Hello, I'm Joe, an aspiring web developer currently residing in California. I am master of none and beholden to many most of the day, but sometimes I get to fool around on the computer. I like to write shitty javascript that doesn't work, and then does strange things when I try to fix it.  

I dabble mostly in frontend. Beyond `HTML`, `CSS`, and `javascript`, I have experience with [`React`](https://reactjs.org/), [`Svelte`](https://svelte.dev/), [`Django`](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [`Express`](https://expressjs.com/) and [`Eleventy`](https://www.11ty.dev/)(which I used to build this site). As far as programming languages go, I know a bit of `python` and `VBA`. 

I'd like to use this site mostly for selfish reasonsâ€”to expand my own knowledge and skills. However, I do hope that one by-product of this is to help others not repeat the same mistakes I have. I think those of us trying to become web developers without a computer science background face particular challenges on our journeys, and I'd like to share some of my own (but only if i find a solution).
