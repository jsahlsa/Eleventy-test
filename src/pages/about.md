# {{ title | capitalize }} Me {.about-me}

Hello, I'm Joe. I have a wife, some kids, some dogs, some cats, and various other animals. I currently reside in sunny California. As of late I have developed a keen interest in computer related stuff, and would like to pursue this interest toward gainful employment. Or at the very least make some cool projects.

I dabble mostly in frontend. Beyond `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`, I have experience with [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) (which I used to build this site). As far as programming languages go, I know a bit of `Python`, `PHP` and `VBA`.
